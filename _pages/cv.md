## Selected projects

* *Capstone: Applying a General Language Model to Medical Text* – Applied multilabel text classification strategies to dataset of 6M+ NYU Langone Health medical notes using deep natural language representation models in PyTorch. We experimented with benefits of fine-tuning in a transfer learning context for transformer-based models such as BERT and XLNet.
* *Data Science: Text Classification with News Articles* – Compared sentiment analysis methods, including Naive Bayes, bag-of-words logistic regression, BOW support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks, for dataset of articles about technology companies from The New York Times.
* *Big Data: Recommender system with PySpark* – Developed recommendation model using alternating least squares (ALS) for implicit feedback in PySpark on Last.fm dataset. We experimented with cold start problem using a latent feature regression model for unknown items.
* *Natural Language Understanding: Building a Semantic Parser to Handle Queries about Song Data* – Built a semantic parser using the SEMPRE framework which can answer queries about a subset of the Million Song Dataset.
* *Numerical Linear Algebra: Implementing an Efficient Matrix Completion Algorithm in Python* – Implemented SoftImpute-ALS algorithm in Python based on the original paper with testing on MovieLens-100K for recommendations. We compared RMSE results with those obtained by block coordinate descent.
